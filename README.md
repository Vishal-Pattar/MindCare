# Mental Health Support System

## Inspiration
The escalating prevalence of mental health issues like stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depression highlights the urgent need for accessible, round-the-clock support. Social stigma, limited access to care, and overburdened psychiatrists create barriers for those in need. Our mission is to bridge this gap with an AI-driven companion that offers continuous mental health support while enabling professionals to focus on severe cases.

## What It Does
The **Mental Health Support System** leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to provide:
- **24/7 Support:** A scalable platform offering constant mental health assistance.
- **Companion Chatbot:** A Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot designed to understand human emotions and respond empathetically.
- **Personalized Care:** Tailored responses based on user interactions and feedback, ensuring a unique experience for every individual.

## How We Built It
Our solution is powered by advanced AI and web technologies, including:
- **Core Technologies:**
  - LLM (Large Language Model)
  - Transformers
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Vector Databases
  - Generative AI Agents
- **Web Technologies:**
  - MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js
  - Authentication via JWT Tokens
  - Development tools like Postman for API testing
- **Model Architecture:**
  - Fine-tuned LLM integrated with RAG for precise and efficient response generation.

## Challenges We Ran Into
Building this system presented several challenges:
- Ensuring anonymity and data privacy for users.
- Complying with regulatory standards in mental health care.
- Selecting and optimizing AI architecture for real-time responsiveness.
- Addressing ethical concerns around AI in mental health.
